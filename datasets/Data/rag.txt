RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

it combines a retriever and a Generator

Retriever:
Searches a vector database for relevant chunks.

Generator:
Uses retrieved context to produce grounded answers.

Benefits:
- Reduces hallucinations
- Uses external knowledge

RAG is useful when the LLM does not have access to your private or updated documents.
Instead of relying on memorization, it retrieves the most relevant information from a vector database.
This improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucinations because the model answers using real retrieved context.
Typical use cases include company policies, internal documentation, FAQs, and product manuals.
RAG also improves transparency because you can return the source chunks used in the answer.
